## Description

It's basic E-commerce app with a lot of features.\
I created this app to improve my React and redux skills.\
You have ability to search products with search bar.\
Search bar is showing you suggestions.

Hardest thing to make in this project was search bar with suggestions.\
But after much trials and errors I managed to finish this project.\
I'm really happy with the results. App is available there: [link](https://musikhood.github.io/ecommerce/)
